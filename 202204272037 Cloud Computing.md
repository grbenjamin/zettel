# Cloud Computing
> **Cloud Computing** is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

This resources run on server computers that are located in large datacenters in different locations around the world. When you use a cloud service provider like AWS you're using the computer *owned* by that server's provider.

Cloud computing makes you stop thinking of your infrastructure as *hardware*, instead, think it as *software*. In the traditional compute model, infrastructure is thought as hardware.

With this hardware approach, you must ask if there is enough resource capacity to meet your needs. If you don't reach the maximum peek of your hardware, then you'll pay for expensive resources that stay idle and don't render you any benefit. If you exceed your peek, then you will not have the capacity to fit your needs and your customer will not recieve the services that they desire.

By contrast, cloud computing enables you to think of infrastructure as software. Software solutions are flexible. 
This means that: 
- You can select the services that fit your needs
- You also only pay for what you use,  when you use it. 
- You can scale resources up and down in an automated way, as to expand and contract your deployment in order to meet your customer's demand. 

With the cloud computing model, you can treat resources in a *temporal* and *disposable* manner.

Compared to hardware solutions, software solutions can change much more **quickly**, **easily**, and **cost effectively**.

## Cloud service models
There are three cloud service models: **Infrastructure as a Service** (IaaS), **Platform as a Service** (PaaS), and **Software as a Service** (SaaS).
Each model represent a different part of the cloud computing stack and gives you a different level of control over your IT resources.

### Infrastructure as a Service
Provides the highest level of flexibility and control over your IT resources.

### Platform as a Service
Removes the need for you to manage the underlying infrastructure. Usually this relates to the hardware and the operating system, and does it through automation, and allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your application, as supposed to the provisioning. 

### Software as a Service
Provides a complete product that is run and managed by the service provider. In most cases, SaaS refers to end-user applications. With SaaS, you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrasctructure is managed. You only have to think about how you will use that particular software.

## Cloud Computing deployment models
These represent the cloud environments that your applications can be deployed in.

### Cloud-based application
A cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud in the all-in-the-cloud type of implementation. All parts of the application will be running in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated to an existing infrastructure.

### Hibrid implementation
In a hibrid implementation, the deployment is in such a way that to connect your existing infrastructure and applications to a cloud-based said resources. They are not located in the cloud, they're located in your physical facilities.

### On-premises
Deploying services on-premises use virtualization and resource management tools, sometimes called private clouds. While on-premises deployment does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing, it is sometimes resorted for its ability to provide dedicated resources.
