At a class full of people [Rob](https://www.twitch.tv/rwxrob) asked "**Who can tell me what X is?**"
Some kid googled up the question, that he didn't know the answer to, and answered to Rob. Some other person in the same room said "hey, that's not fair! he googled it up!" and he was like "yeah and **he looked it up faster than you, didn't he**?"

They got shut down.
