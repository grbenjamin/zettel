# Advantages of Cloud Computing
1. #### Trade capital expense for variable expense
Capital expenses are funds that a company uses to adquire, upgrade and maintain physical assets such as property, industrial buildings or equipment.
*You must pay* for everything in the datacenter, whether you use it or not.
By contrast, a variable cost, is a cost that one can easily lower or avoid by using [[202204272037 Cloud Computing | Cloud Computing]]. Instead of investing heavily in datacenters or servers before you know how you will use them, you can pay **only when you consume resources** and **only for the amount that you consume**. Maintenance is reduced, so you can focus on your needs and the needs of your business.
2. #### Benefit from massive economies of scale
By using Cloud Computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your very own, because usage of hundreds of thousands of customers is added up in the cloud. Providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale. That traslates as to **lower pay-as-you-go prices to you**.
3. #### Eliminating guessing about your infrastructure capacity needs
When you make decisions about capacity before you deploy an application, you either have expensive idle resources, or deal with limited capacity. 
With Cloud Computing, this problems go away. You can access as *much or as little* as you need, and **scale up an down** as required with only a few minutes notice.
4. #### Increases speed and agility
In a Cloud Computing environment, new IT resources are *only a click away*, which means that you reduce the time it takes to make those **resources available**. 
The result is a dramatic increase of agility for the organization because the cost and time that it takes to experiment and develop are significantly lower.
5. #### Stop spending money on running and maintaining datacenters
Cloud Computing enables you to focus on your own customers instead of the manual servers.
6. #### Go global in minutes
You can deploy your application in multiple AWS regions around the world with just a few clicks. As a result, you can provide **lower latency** and a better experience for your customer, simply and at a minimal cost.
